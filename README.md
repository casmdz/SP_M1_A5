## Comments

I created a mock site for a yoga studio. I feel like I could have chosed to do a gym in general and that wouldve given me more content, but I kept it simple. 

I used dribble for inspiration, other yoga sites, and bootstrap sites. I used unsplash to source images, as well as freepik. I also used Canva to create a custom logo. 

I always like bootstrap and flexbox, especially in this project which I wanted it to be easier to style.
